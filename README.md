> **Important Note:**
> This series of Wacom products is now discontinued and support for them is no longer offered.

## Introduction

---

*Wacom Ink SDK for documents* provides software components to add metadata to a PDF document, conforming to the Wacom Ink Document Metadata Format.
The SDK provides an API to manipulate the extended metadata saved in a PDF document.

> Note that the SDK uses the name BaXter extensively. This is for historic reasons:
> The Baxter SDKs were initially created to support CLB-Create and CLB-Paper applications developed for the Wacom Clipboard PHU-111, codenamed Barbera.
> The source of the name Baxter is �Barbera Extensible Translator�.

The SDKs can be used universally to extend the contents of PDF documents, as described in:
[Wacom Ink Document Metadata Format](http://developer-docs.wacom.com/sdk-for-documents/docs/idml-format)


A full description of the API is included in the SDK.
